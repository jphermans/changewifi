# wpa_supplicant.conf changer!
## _Change the wpa_supplicant.conf file on your raspberry pi._

You don't have to start raspi-config to change the wifi settings of your pi.
If python is installed then you can run this file with the following command:

```sh
sudo python changewifi.py ssid password
```
For ssid and wifi you have to fill in the ssid and password you want to use!
Example:
```sh
sudo python changewifi.py home myPassword
```
## Enjoy it!
